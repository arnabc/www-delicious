= WWW::Delicious

WWW::Delicious is a Ruby client for http://del.icio.us XML API.

It provides both read and write functionalities. You can read user Posts, Tags
and Bundles but you can create new Posts, Tags and Bundles as well.


== Overview

WWW::Delicious maps all the original del.icio.us API calls and provides some
additional convenient methods to perform common tasks.
Please read the official documentation (http://del.icio.us/help/api/)
to learn more about del.icio.us API.

WWW::Delicious is 100% compatible with all del.icio.us API constraints,
including the requirement to set a valid user agent or wait at least
one second between queries.
Basically, the main benefit from using this library is that you don't need
to take care of all these low level details, if you don't want:
WWW::Delicious will try to give you the most with less efforts.


== Dependencies

* Ruby 1.8.6


== Download and Installation

Installing WWW::Delicious as a GEM is probably the best and easiest way.
You must have RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] installed
for the following instruction to work:

  $ sudo gem install www_delicious

Please note that the GEM name is www_delicious, this is not a typo!
Because the name WWW::Delicious cannot be used within the GEM repository,
www_delicious is the best normalized name I found to identify the library.

You can also grab the source code from the website and install it manually.
Navigate to the root library directory and enter:

  $ sudo ruby setup.rb

If you need the latest development version you can download the source code
from the SVN repository at http://svn.simonecarletti.com/www_delicious/.
Beware that the code might not as stable as the official release.
